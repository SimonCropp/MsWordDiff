[![NuGet Status](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/MsWordDiff.svg?label=MsWordDiff)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MsWordDiff/)

A .NET tool that compares two Word documents side by side using Microsoft Word's built-in document comparison feature.<!-- singleLineInclude: intro. path: /src/intro.include.md -->

**See [Milestones](../../milestones?state=closed) for release notes.**


## Requirements

 * Windows
 * Microsoft Word installed
 * .NET 10.0 or later


## Installation

Install as a global tool:

```
dotnet tool install -g MsWordDiff
```

https://nuget.org/packages/MsWordDiff/



## Usage

```
diffword <path1> <path2> [--quiet]
```

Where `<path1>` and `<path2>` are paths to the Word documents to compare.

Example:

```
diffword original.docx modified.docx
```

This will open Microsoft Word with a comparison view showing the differences between the two documents. The tool will wait until Word is closed before exiting.

### Options


#### --quiet

Hide source documents in the comparison view, showing only the comparison document.

Example:

```
diffword original.docx modified.docx --quiet
```

##### Showing Original and Revised Panes in Quiet Mode

When using `--quiet` mode, the original and revised document panes are initially hidden. They can be shown at any time within Word:

1. Click the **Review** tab in Word's ribbon
2. In the **Compare** group, click **Compare**
3. Select **Show Source Documents**
4. Choose the preferred view:
   - **Show Both** - Displays both original and revised documents in the right pane
   - **Show Original** - Shows only the original document
   - **Show Revised** - Shows only the revised document
   - **Hide Source Documents** - Returns to quiet mode (comparison only)

When both documents are visible, they scroll in sync with the comparison document for side-by-side review.

### On first execution

On first execution the user will be prompted to choose their preferred UX mode (Standard or Quiet).

### Configuration

The default behavior of options can be configured using settings commands.


#### View settings

```
diffword settings
```

This displays the settings file path and current settings.

```
C:\Users\SimonCropp\.config\MsWordDiff\settings.json
{
  "Quiet": true
}
```

By default, settings are stored in:

```
%USERPROFILE%\.config\MsWordDiff\settings.json
```


#### Configure default Quiet mode

```
diffword set-quiet <true|false>
```

Set the default value for the Quiet option. When set to `true`, the source documents will be hidden by default.

Examples:

```
diffword set-quiet true
diffword set-quiet false
```

Note: Command-line options always override settings file values.


## DiffEngine Integration

MsWordDiff is supported by [DiffEngine](https://github.com/VerifyTests/DiffEngine), making it available as a diff tool for [Verify](https://github.com/VerifyTests/Verify) snapshot testing.

When using Verify to test Word document output, DiffEngine can launch MsWordDiff to show differences between expected and actual documents.

To prioritize MsWordDiff as the diff tool:

```cs
DiffTools.UseOrder(DiffTool.MsWordDiff);
```

See [DiffEngine Diff Tool documentation](https://github.com/VerifyTests/DiffEngine/blob/main/docs/diff-tool.md#msworddiff) for more details.


## How It Works

The tool uses COM automation to:

 1. Open both documents in Microsoft Word (read-only)
 2. Generate a comparison document using Word's `CompareDocuments` feature
 3. Display the comparison with tracked changes highlighting differences
 4. Automatically close Word when the parent process exits
